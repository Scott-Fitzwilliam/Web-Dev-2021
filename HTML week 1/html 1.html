    <!-- HTML Basic -->
    <h1>My first Heading and such</h1>
    <p>My first (but not really) paragraph</p>
    <p>HTML's should always be initialised with ! to autofill the HTML info.</p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">This is the link of the gods!</a>

    <!-- HTML Elements -->
    <h1>there are 6 headings</h1>
    <p>Paragraphs create a line break but you can make you're own extra line break with a <br> like this.</p>


    <!-- HTML Attributes -->
    <!-- Attribures give html special properties or additional properties to an element. They are often neccessary for some elements to work such as links requiring a href to go to the url. -->

    <!-- HTML Headings -->
    <h6>bold</h6>
    <h5>bolder</h5>
    <h4>Quite large</h4>
    <h3>Big</h3>
    <h2>Bigger</h2>
    <h1>Biggest</h1>

    <!-- HTML Paragraphs -->
    <p>pretty straight forward here</p>
    <p>Paragraphs can have many lines 
        inside the paragraph element 
        but won't acknowledge them, only a <p>paragraph tag</p>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>This line break is shown br hr which stands for horizontal rule.</p>

    <pre>
        Pre keeps your formating
        as you write it in the element.
        This lets you keep lines you want
        Not that this is common to use.
        Appartently it also gives it a slightly different and elegant font.
    </pre>

    <!-- HTML Styles -->
    <p style="color: blueviolet;">Style changes the aesthetic</p> 
    <p style="font-size: 40px; display: inline;" > It can change many features, big
        <p style="display: inline; font-size: 10px;"></p> or small</p>
    <p style="color: chartreuse;">Not to meantion colour</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;"> and Positioning</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Among other things</p>
    <p></p>

    <!-- HTML Formatting -->
    <p>Formating is just the classic messing around with how text looks or giving it special meaning such an <em>Italics with the em tag</em>, <strong>Making things stand out and be bold with the strong tag.</strong></p>
    <p>And a couple other nifty tricks that a bit more uncommon such as <del>The deleted tag</del></p>
    <P>You can also have fun with <sub>subscrited text, if you want to make little notation</sub> as well as <sup>Superscript</sup> but that's my super secret trademark <sup>tm</sup></P>
    

    <!-- HTML Quotations -->
    <!-- I honestly feel blockquotes could be done better with just css styling  -->
    <blockquote>hello there</blockquote>
   <q>The <abbr title="Special Air Service">SAS</abbr> is australia's most elite miltary unit </q>


    <!-- HTML Comments -->
    <!-- I feel like nothing more be said here XD -->


    <!-- HTML Colors -->
    <!-- basically the same as sytles, and should be done in css anyway. Involves different ways of setting up colours -->
    <p style="color: rgb(200, 100, 100);">The use of RGB is one way to pick colours</p>
    <p style="color: rgba(000, 256, 000, 0.5);">This is RGB woith alpha, which controls transparency </p>
    <p style="color: #0000ff;"> Hexadecial works the same as RGB but works on the hexadecial system ff is just 16 squared which is 256, the same maximum value that rgb has, it is simply different notation.</p>


    <!-- HTML CSS -->
    <!-- CSS is CSS. Enough said. -->


    <!-- HTML Links -->
    <!-- A very useful and essential feature to linking a Css style sheet to the html -->
    <p>It uses the <link rel="stylesheet" href="Insertreference here">Insertreference here</p>
    

    <!-- HTML Images -->
    <!-- i'm good here -->


    <!-- HTML Tables -->
    <p>table contains it, tr is the row, t head represents headings and a auto bold and td is for the data.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Company</th>
          <th>Contact</th>
          <th>Country</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
          <td>Maria Anders</td>
          <td>Germany</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
          <td>Francisco Chang</td>
          <td>Mexico</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ernst Handel</td>
          <td>Roland Mendel</td>
          <td>Austria</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>make sure to close your elements lest, your list be in your table lol</p>
        
    <!-- HTML Lists -->
    <ol>
        <li>This is a an ordered list and has alpha-numeric sequences</li>
        <li>Each item on this the list is it's own li element</li>
        <li>Another listed item number 3</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>This is an unordered list</li>
        <li>There is no order, except the order you enter the elements, good for things that don't need to be sequential like a shopping list for example.</li>
        <li>more list!</li>
    </ul>


    <!-- HTML Block & Inline -->
    <div>Behold the div! The most important elementin all of html.</div>
    <p>block elemetns creat a new line or space when they are used, they create "blocks" of text or content if you will. Very important for web pages</p>
    <p>inline text uses thigs such as <span> span which works like a p element but inline rather then a block, so it doesn not create a new line like a p</span></p>
    <p>other examples include making <b>things bold</b> or <em>italic, both are inline</em></p>
