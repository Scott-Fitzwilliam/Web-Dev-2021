Reflection:

8a. Creating adequate space in the list elements to create an eye pleasing gap between the List heading, the dates for the academic/work experience and the lorem ipsum beneath it.

8b. I'm still surprised this wasn't set to it original test condtions of 90 minutes. Given endless time, perfect was a straight forward process. Had i had less time, it would likely have bit a bit less neatly spaced. 

8c. probably 2 or 3 times for the line height documentation.

8d. Q&A definitely, but some independant explain sites were useful. Documentation is usually to dense to be be engaging and efficient in time constrain siturations.
