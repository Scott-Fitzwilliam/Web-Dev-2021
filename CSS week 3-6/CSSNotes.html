    <p>There are 6 basic slectors in CSS that most commonly used.
    <p class="example">The first and most useful is classes.</p>
    <p class="example">A class is created in a CSS file using a fullstop followed by the name of the class. i.e .example  and it can then be applied to a html element by adding the attribute class="The name of your class", in the example it would be class="example" as can be observed in this p element.</p>
    <p>The class will affect all html elements with that class, so it can be reused many times, and has the added benefit of only the specific elements you want to have the class. For example if you wanted the previous paragraphs to have red text with a black underline, but not this paragraph. the class attribute will allow you to do this easily.</p>
    <h2 class="example"> Classes are not limited by element type, and this h2 element will be affected in the same one as the previous p elements.</h2>
